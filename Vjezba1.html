"BMW launched its crossover coupe in 2008, the BMW X6, and Mercedes-Benz followed suit in 2015 with the GLE-Class Coupe. Audi never made a direct competitor, but had been planning to once the new bodystyle became a sales success for other brands.
SUVs, particularly in the luxury segment, are increasingly popular, and the Q8 is expected to sell in higher numbers than the A8."

<p>
"The Audi Q8 was presented to the public in concept form on 9 January 2017, at the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit, Michigan.
In May 2018, Audi started a cinematic styled miniseries that teases the Audi Q8 in five short episodes. The car made its first full appearance in the fifth episode, presented on a special microsite and shown to the public at the Audi China Brand Summit in Shenzhen.
In September 2018, the Audi Q8 was launched in Thailand approves the first impression: The SUV coupe it's powered by a 3.0L TFSI engine with Quattro name Audi Q8 55 TFSI Quattro S Line.
The Q8 was launched in Malaysia in March 2019 where it is powered by a 3.0L TFSI engine with Quattro."

"The Audi Q8 will be the first SUV model under Audi's new head of design, Marc Lichte, and it will introduce a new design language for the brand's SUVs. The grill is larger and now has an octagonal shape, with both vertical and horizontal slats, and the character lines of the Q8 are inspired by the Audi Quattro rally car from the 1980s. The Audi Q8 features full-laser headlamps and taillamps, the first-ever in a crossover or SUV. The interior features the knob-less MMI system, three touch screens and an enlarged virtual cockpit which has a fully digital instrument cluster. Additionally, both haptic and acoustic feedback are provided in response to user inputs.
The Q8 is slightly shorter than the Q7 in terms of both length and height, but is slightly wider. It also has less cargo space than the Q7 due to its sloped roofline, and unlike the Q7, the Q8 is not available with third-row seats."

"A performance-focused Audi SQ8 was launched in June 2019 with chassis revisions, and styling and technology upgrades. It features a new 4.0-litre Biturbo V8 mild-hybrid diesel engine with 429bhp and 900Nm (664 lb-ft) of torque. The US model will use a Biturbo V8 with the same displacement (shared with the US-market SQ7), albeit fueled by gasoline/petrol and producing 500bhp and 770Nm (568 lb-ft) of torque; it will go on sale in late spring 2020.[15] Performance is sent through the 8-speed Tiptronic automatic gearbox to its quattro all-wheel drive system. Euro-spec models have a claimed acceleration of 0-100 km/h in 4.8 seconds (0-60 mph in 4.6 seconds) with an electronically-limited top speed of 249 km/h (155 mph).
The new turbochargers are situated within the “V” of the engine block, which Audi claims creates better engine response. To further reduce the effects of turbo lag, the engine features sequential turbocharging, with only a small charger active at low engine speeds and a larger charger engaging above 2,200rpm. An electric-powered compressor assists the turbocharger when starting and accelerating from lower speeds, compensating for the turbo's lack of boost at low revs by adding extra pressure to the intake to smooths out power delivery."

                <li><p>Modern era of audi.Audi's sales grew strongly in the 2000s, with deliveries to customers increasing from 653,000 in 2000 to 1,003,000 in 2008. The largest sales increases came from Eastern Europe (+19.3%), Africa (+17.2%) and the Middle East (+58.5%). China in particular has become a key market, representing 108,000 out of 705,000 cars delivered in the first three quarters of 2009. One factor for its popularity in China is that Audis have become the car of choice for purchase by the Chinese government for officials, and purchases by the government are responsible for 20% of its sales in China.[38]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi#Modern_era"</a> As of late 2009, Audi's operating profit of €1.17 billion ($1.85 billion) made it the biggest contributor to parent Volkswagen Group's nine-month operating profit of €1.5 billion, while the other marques in Group such as Bentley and SEAT had suffered considerable losses.[39] May 2011 saw record sales for Audi of America with the new Audi A7 and Audi A3 TDI Clean Diesel.[40] In May 2012, Audi reported a 10% increase in its sales—from 408 units to 480 in the last year alone.</p></li>
			
			
			    <li><p>Audi introduced a new series of vehicles in the mid-1990s and continues to pursue new technology and high performance. An all-aluminium car was brought forward by Audi, and in 1994 the Audi A8 was launched,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi#Modern_era"></a> which introduced aluminium space frame technology (called Audi Space Frame or ASF) which saves weight and improves torsion rigidity compared to a conventional steel frame. Prior to that effort, Audi used examples of the Type 44 chassis fabricated out of aluminium as test-beds for the technique. The disadvantage of the aluminium frame is that it is very expensive to repair and requires a specialized aluminium bodyshop.[60] The weight reduction is somewhat offset by the quattro four-wheel drive system which is standard in most markets. Nonetheless, the A8 is usually the lightest all-wheel drive car in the full-size luxury segment, also having best-in-class fuel economy.[61] The Audi A2, Audi TT and Audi R8 also use Audi Space Frame designs.</p></li>
